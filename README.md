Now it would be very remarkable if any system existing in the real world could be *exactly* represented by any simple model. However, cunningly chosen parsimonious models often do provide remarkably useful approximations.

It has been said that "all models are wrong but some models are useful." In other words, any model is at best a useful fiction—there never was, or ever will be, an exactly normal distribution or an exact linear relationship. Nevertheless, enormous progress has been made by entertaining such fictions and using them as approximations.
